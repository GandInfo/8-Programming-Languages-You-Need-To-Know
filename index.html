       <div class="crip">
    <p>Welcome to the dynamic world of programming languages, where creativity meets logic to bring your innovative ideas to life. Whether you're a technology enthusiast, a knowledge-hungry student, or an experienced developer, exploring the top programming languages is essential to staying up-to-date and relevant in the ever-evolving technology landscape.</p>

    <h2>1: HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML, which stands for "Hypertext Markup Language", is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. Initially developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML is a fundamental part of the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p>HTML is a language that uses a special syntax, made up of elements or tags, that surround content to tell the browser how that content should be displayed. Each HTML tag has a specific function, such as defining titles, paragraphs, links, images, tables, among other elements.</p>
    <p>HTML works together with other web technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. These three technologies form the basis of modern web development, enabling the creation of interactive and visually appealing web pages.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>2: CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS, which stands for "Cascading Style Sheets", is a styling language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. While HTML is responsible for the structure and content of a web page, CSS complements this structure, allowing developers to apply styles, colors, fonts, spacing and other visual aspects.    </p>
    <p>Main features of CSS:    </p>
    <h3>Selector and Properties:    </h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Selector: Indicates which HTML element will be styled.</li>
    <li>Properties: Visual characteristics that will be applied to the element, such as color, font size, margins, etc.</li>
    <h3>Waterfall:</h3>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Cascading refers to the priority order of CSS rules. If there are conflicts between rules, the browser follows a hierarchy to determine which rule should be applied.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Flexibility and Reusability:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS allows developers to create styles separately from HTML content, which makes it easier to maintain and reuse styles across multiple pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Responsiveness: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS is key to making web pages responsive, adjusting the layout and style based on the screen or device size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3: JavaScript    </h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language widely used to create interactivity on web pages. It was originally developed by Netscape and called "LiveScript", but was renamed JavaScript when Netscape teamed up with Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) and released the Netscape Navigator browser.</p>
    <p>Main features of JavaScript:</p>
    <h3>Client-Side Scripting: </h3>
    <ul>
    <li>JavaScript is primarily known for being a client-side scripting language, which means the code runs in the user's browser. It is used to manipulate the structure, content, and style of web pages after initial loading.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interactivity and Dynamism:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>JavaScript allows the creation of dynamic web pages, responding to user actions such as clicks, mouse movements, filling out forms, etc. This creates a more interactive experience for users.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM, which is a tree representation of the HTML page structure. This manipulation allows the addition, removal and modification of HTML elements and their attributes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Asynchrony:    </h3>
    <ul>
    <li>JavaScript supports asynchronous operations, which is crucial for handling tasks that shouldn't block the rest of your code from executing. This is often used in API calls, event handling, and input/output operations. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frameworks and Libraries:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>There are many popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that simplify the development of complex web applications and provide frameworks for creating reactive user interfaces. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Multiplataform:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>JavaScript is not just limited to browsers. With the advent of Node.js, developers can also use JavaScript on the server side, allowing the creation of web applications completely based on JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
